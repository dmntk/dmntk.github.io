# Decision Model and Notation Toolkit

## Overview

**DMNTK** is a set of tools for building, testing and evaluating decision models.
**DMNTK** is based on the [Decision Model and Notation (DMN™)](https://www.omg.org/dmn/) specification,
the industry standard led by the [Object Management Group (OMG®)](https://www.omg.org/),
the institution behind such standards like UML®, BPMN™ and CORBA®.
**DMNTK** is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a programming language that empowers
building reliable and efficient software.
**DMNTK** aspires to be the fastest and fully compliant with [DMN™ specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN)
decision model evaluator.

Main **DMNTK** features:

- Evaluation of DMN models as a service.
- Evaluation of decision tables.
- Evaluation of FEEL expressions.
- Parsing and validating DMN models.
- Parsing and recognizing decision tables.
- Parsing and validating FEEL expressions.
- Testing DMN models.
- Testing decision tables.
- Testing FEEL expressions.
- Exporting DMN decision models to HTML.

To install the examples run:

```
$ dmntk exs
```

### Evaluate FEEL expression

```text
$ cd ./examples/e1
$ dmntk efe e1.ctx e1.feel
3
```

### Evaluate DMN model

```text
$ cd ./examples/e2
$ dmntk edm e2.ctx e2.dmn -i "Greeting Message"
"Hello John Doe"
```

### Evaluate decision table

```text
$ cd ./examples/e3
$ dmntk edt e3.ctx e3.dtb
0.15
```

### Run as a service

```text
$ cd ./examples/e2
$ dmntk srv -H 127.0.0.1 -D .
